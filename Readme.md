# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using the `load_digits` dataset from `sklearn`. The dataset consists of 8x8 pixel grayscale images of digits, and the goal is to classify these digits accurately using machine learning techniques.

### Objective
The main goal of this phase is to:
1. Build a robust digit recognition model using Random Forest Classifier.
2. Optimize the model using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.
3. Analyze the results and prepare for the next phase of the project, which involves scaling up to more complex datasets like MNIST.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this phase is `load_digits` from `sklearn.datasets`. Key characteristics of the dataset:
- **Number of samples**: 1797
- **Image resolution**: 8x8 pixels
- **Number of classes**: 10 (digits 0 through 9)

## Methodology

### 1. Baseline Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Parameters**: `n_estimators=1000`
- **Performance**:
  - Accuracy: **98%**
  - Classification metrics (precision, recall, f1-score) across all classes are close to 1.

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
- **Objective**: Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving essential features.
- **Method**: PCA with `n_components=30`.
- **Results**:
  - Accuracy: **98%**
  - Slight changes in precision and recall for some classes (e.g., class 1 and class 8).

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
- **Objective**: Optimize Random Forest parameters for better performance.
- **Parameters Tuned**:
  - `n_estimators`: [500, 1000, 1500]
  - `max_depth`: [10, 20, None]
  - `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10]
  - `min_samples_leaf`: [1, 2, 4]
- **Best Parameters Found**:
  - `max_depth=20`
  - `min_samples_leaf=1`
  - `min_samples_split=2`
  - `n_estimators=1000`
- **Results**:
  - Accuracy: **98%**
  - Improved precision for class 8.

## Results & Analysis
- The **Random Forest Classifier** performed exceptionally well on the `load_digits` dataset.
- **PCA** reduced the dimensionality of the dataset without significantly affecting accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** using GridSearchCV slightly improved the model's precision for certain classes.

**Key Observation**:
While the model achieves high accuracy, certain classes (e.g., class 1 and class 8) showed minor variations in precision and recall. These variations highlight potential areas for improvement, such as increasing the dataset size or applying Data Augmentation.

## Next Steps
The next phase of the project will focus on scaling the model to larger and more complex datasets like MNIST. Key improvements planned for the next phase:
1. Transition from traditional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to deep learning architectures like CNNs.
2. Implement Data Augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
3. Perform advanced hyperparameter tuning using tools like Keras Tuner.
